Facebook <nav>EXECUTIVE EDITOR RORY CARROLL: As much as I drone on and on about preferring manual transmissions, I was really surprised by the degree to which I preferred the manual-equipped M3 over the one we have in the long-term fleet. The long-termer is faster, and the M3’s manual shifter isn’t the best we’ve ever operated, but damned if it doesn’t change the character of the car for the better. Maybe I’m just imagining it, but I feel like I have a better sense of what the engine, brakes, tires and chassis are doing when I have the clutch as an extra point of input.

A MANUAL CHANGES THE BMW M3’S DYNAMIC FOR THE BETTER

EXECUTIVE EDITOR RORY CARROLL: As much as I drone on and on about preferring manual transmissions, I was really surprised by the degree to which I preferred the manual-equipped M3 over the one we have in the long-term fleet. The long-termer is faster, and the M3’s manual shifter isn’t the best we’ve ever operated, but damned if it doesn’t change the character of the car for the better. Maybe I’m just imagining it, but I feel like I have a better sense of what the engine, brakes, tires and chassis are doing when I have the clutch as an extra point of input.  

Where the dual-clutch is ridiculously fast, the shift-it-yourself car is ridiculously fast and also fun. If you plan on stripping the car, adding a cage and using it to start your own professional race team, you’ll want some version of the dual-clutch car. If every single tenth could mean the difference between a big purse and a small one, if you’re competing with money on the line, then you’ll probably want some version of the dual-clutch car. However, if you’re planning to drive it on the street and occasionally track it, the manual will be more fun and more engaging to drive. It may be a few tenths slower, but it’s still more than fast enough to stomp just about anything you’re likely to encounter in the wild, if that’s what you’re into.

The styling is still way over the top, inside and out, but that’s much easier to forgive when I’m enjoying the drive.
