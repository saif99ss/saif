<li><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nEkNrcLhRdA/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Smiley face" height="200" width="250"> He is the perfect player, A complete package who can dribble, juggle, freekick, deadly crosses, long range efforts, never ending stamina, great accuracy with both feet, serious pace, his height which he can achieve when he jumps for the ball, perfect body shape, unforgettable free kicks and last but not the least he is from Portugal and unarguably he is the player they have ever produced and might not produce same again, his country of origin is not that famous as for pele, maradona, messi, ronaldhino and zidane but still he is now among them which means his will and hunger for goals and win is greater then any of em! I love his style! </li>
